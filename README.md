# Smol-Ame-TAS-Inputs
A repository for storing inputs for TAS made for the Smol Ame game

# Instructions for adding Inputs
- Upload inputs in the following manner [Level Name]/[Category]/[Time]/[Character Used]
- Initiate a pull request with a brief drescription like "Added AO any% 8.785 run"
- If you want to request a run for other people to TAS, you can add an issue and if someone has an interest and the TAS can do it (some levels like PoR cannot be TASed right now) they might try it. Anyone is welcome to try to TAS the game.
- The TASing is done through [smolTAS](https://github.com/Sh1r0Yaksha/SmolTAS) and [SALT](https://github.com/MegaPiggy/SALT) and all instructions of installing and making the TASes are given there

### The TASes can all be seen in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-WeGPOzOv_xansiNIpr-0fnO4pMv2TUuQdooDiYAG8/edit#gid=0)
